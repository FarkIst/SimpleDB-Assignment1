# SimpleDB-Assignment1

## Description

simpledb_write: creates random data, in order to add custom data in the database, use the add("key", "value") function in simpledb_write.py

simpledb_read: prints the random data, since I am generating 10 different string, I added a while loop to print the first 10 indexes. If you want to get 
a specific line, with a specific key, call the function getValue("key"), and run the python file in terminal.
